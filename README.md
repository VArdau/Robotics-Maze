## Description
#### I have implemented solutions for several tasks, including:
#### - A simple algorthm to escape the maze.
#### - Finding the quickest route out using the previous algorithm and a list.
#### - Returning the robot to its home position (start).
#### - Partially mapping the maze.
#### These solutions have helped me learn a lot, and I enjoyed trying out new approaches to make things work.
